# Presentation giving an overview about garbage collection in JVM 1.8

The presentation should be delivered from a web server, otherwise the AJAX loading used by Reveal.js and Processing.js will not work.

You can run a local web server for example with `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 6789`

or with `ruby -run -e httpd 6789 . -p 6789`
